    """
    Defines a Bazel macro for creating a `java_binary` target that integrates the DASH license checker.
    The generated target is always named 'license_check', and an alias 'license-check' is automatically
    created pointing to it.

    Usage (Explicit mode):
      Provide the 'src' explicitly.
      
      If 'file_type' is omitted (empty string) and a project_config is provided, the file_type is
      determined from the "source_code" field in project_config.
      
      Example project_config (project_config.bzl):
      
          PROJECT_CONFIG = {
              "asil_level": "QM",
              "source_code": ["python"]
          }
      
      - If "python" is present, file_type becomes "requirements".
      - If "rust" is present, file_type becomes "cargo".
    
    Example usage:
    
         dash_license_checker(
             visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
             src = "//docs:requirements",  # a filegroup target pointing to your requirements.txt file
             file_type = "",                # omitted so that it's determined from project_config
             project_config = PROJECT_CONFIG
         )
    """

    # Determine file_type from project_config if not provided.
    if file_type == "":
