# Validation Integration Tests

End-to-end tests for the `validation_cli` binary. Each test case feeds real
PlantUML diagrams through the full pipeline — PlantUML parser → FlatBuffers
binary → validation CLI — and asserts the outcome against a JSON fixture.

## Directory structure

```

├── BUILD                        # test binaries + aggregated filegroups
├── puml_fixture.bzl             # Starlark rule: provider → category dirs
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs                   # re-exports from test_framework
│   ├── test_framework.rs        # shared helpers (CLI runner, assertions)
│   ├── bazel_component_suite.rs # tests for BazelComponent validator
│   ├── component_class_suite.rs # tests for ComponentClass validator
│   └── component_sequence_suite.rs # tests for ComponentSequence validator
```

## How it works

The framework has three layers.

### Layer 1 — PlantUML parsing (Bazel rules)

Each test case BUILD calls the real production rules (`architectural_design`,
`unit_design`) on its `.puml` source files. Bazel runs the `puml_parser` binary
as a cached action and stores the result as a FlatBuffers binary (`.fbs.bin`).
The output is exposed through providers:

| Rule | Provider | Fields used |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `architectural_design` | `ArchitecturalDesignInfo` | `static` (component), `dynamic` (sequence), `internal_api` (internal API) |
| `unit_design` | `UnitDesignInfo` | `static` (class), `dynamic` (sequence) |

### Layer 2 — Fixture preparation (`puml_fixture.bzl`)

The `provider_fbs_fixture_bundle` rule reads the provider fields from its `deps`
and creates a predictable directory layout that the Rust test binary can
navigate at runtime:

```
fbs/
├── component/    ← from ArchitecturalDesignInfo.static
├── class/        ← from UnitDesignInfo.static
├── internal_api/ ← from ArchitecturalDesignInfo.internal_api, when present
└── sequence/     ← from ArchitecturalDesignInfo.dynamic + UnitDesignInfo.dynamic
```

Each file in these directories is a **symlink** to the canonical `.fbs.bin`
produced in layer 1. No copying or re-parsing occurs; the underlying Bazel
action cache entry is reused.

A `filegroup` named `case_data` then bundles the `fbs` target together with the
static fixture files (`architecture.json`, `expected.json`), making the whole
case available as a single Bazel dependency.

For `ComponentSequence` cases that exercise method-level validation, the suite
also reads `internal_api/*.fbs.bin` and forwards those files to the CLI as
`--internal-api-fbs`.

### Layer 3 — CLI invocation (Rust test binary)

There is one `rust_test` binary per validator. Each binary lists the relevant
`case_data` filegroups and the `validation_cli` binary in its `data` attribute
so that Bazel places them under `TEST_SRCDIR` at test time.

The shared `test_framework` library provides the following helpers:

| Helper | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `collect_case_fbs_files(suite, case, category)` | Returns sorted absolute paths to every `.fbs.bin` in a category subdirectory |
| `load_expected_fixture(suite, case)` | Deserialises `expected.json` into `ExpectedFixture` |
| `run_validation_cli(case_name, cli_args)` | Spawns the CLI binary, writes its log to `TEST_TMPDIR`, returns `CliRunResult` |
| `assert_cli_result(case, expected, result)` | Asserts exit code and checks each string in `error_contains` against the log |

Each `#[test]` function calls an `assert_case(case_dir)` helper that wires these
steps together.

### Artifact flow for one test case

```
component_diagram.puml
        │
        │  architectural_design Bazel rule
        │  → puml_parser action (cached per .puml content)
        ▼
design/component_diagram.fbs.bin        ← in ArchitecturalDesignInfo.static

        │  provider_fbs_fixture_bundle rule
        │  → symlink action (zero cost)
        ▼
fbs/component/component_diagram.fbs.bin ← symlink → file above

        │  filegroup case_data
        │  → bundles fbs + architecture.json + expected.json
        ▼
bazel_component_test_data               ← aggregated across all cases

        │  rust_test data = [...]
        │  → placed under TEST_SRCDIR at test execution
        ▼
bazel_component_integration_test
        │
        │  collect_case_fbs_files()  → absolute paths to .fbs.bin files
        │  load_expected_fixture()   → ExpectedFixture
        │  run_validation_cli()      → spawns validation_cli --output <log>
        │  assert_cli_result()       → checks pass/fail + error substrings
        ▼
PASS / FAIL
```

`ComponentSequence` method-validation cases follow the same flow for
`internal_api_diagram.puml`: the `architectural_design` rule produces
`internal_api/*.fbs.bin`, `provider_fbs_fixture_bundle` materializes those
files under `fbs/internal_api/`, and the suite passes them to `validation_cli`
with `--internal-api-fbs`.

## Test case anatomy

Each test case is a self-contained directory. The exact files required depend on
the validator under test.

### BazelComponent cases

```
<case>/
├── BUILD                 # architectural_design + provider_fbs_fixture_bundle + case_data
├── component_diagram.puml
├── architecture.json     # Bazel build-graph snapshot (components/units)
└── expected.json
```

### ComponentClass cases

```
<case>/
├── BUILD                 # architectural_design + unit_design + provider_fbs_fixture_bundle + case_data
├── component_diagram.puml
├── class_diagram.puml    # one or more; multi-file: class_diagram_part1.puml, ...
└── expected.json
```

### ComponentSequence cases

```
<case>/
├── BUILD                 # architectural_design (static + dynamic, plus optional internal_api) + provider_fbs_fixture_bundle + case_data
├── component_diagram.puml
├── sequence_diagram.puml
├── internal_api_diagram.puml  # optional; include when the case exercises method-level validation
└── expected.json
```

### `expected.json` format

```json
{
  "should_pass": true,
  "error_contains": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `should_pass` | `bool` | Whether the CLI must exit with code 0 |
| `error_contains` | `string[]` | Substrings that must appear in the CLI log on failure. Empty for positive cases. |

The framework uses **substring matching** for `error_contains`, so entries do
not need to reproduce exact formatting — just enough context to uniquely
identify the error.

## Running the tests

Run all integration tests:

```bash
bazel test //validation/core/integration_test/...
```

Run a single suite:

```bash
bazel test //validation/core/integration_test:bazel_component_integration_test
bazel test //validation/core/integration_test:component_class_integration_test
bazel test //validation/core/integration_test:component_sequence_integration_test
```

## Adding a new test case

1. Create a directory under the appropriate suite folder:
   ```
   validation/core/integration_test/<suite>/<case_name>/
   ```

2. Add the `.puml` source file(s) and — for `bazel_component` — an
   `architecture.json`.

3. Write `expected.json`. For negative cases add the error substrings you
   expect to see in the CLI log.

4. Create a `BUILD` file following the pattern of an existing case in the same
   suite.

5. Add the new `case_data` target to the matching filegroup in
   [`BUILD`](BUILD) (`bazel_component_test_data`,
   `component_class_test_data`, or `component_sequence_test_data`).

6. Add a `#[test]` function in the matching suite file under `src/`.

## Caching behaviour

- The `puml_parser` action is shared: the same `.fbs.bin` is used by both
  production `dependable_element` targets and integration test fixtures — no
  redundant parsing.
- Symlinks created by `provider_fbs_fixture_bundle` have zero action cost; the
  cache key for a test case only covers the underlying `puml_parser` action.
- Changing one test case's `.puml` only invalidates actions for that case; the
  other cases and test binaries stay cached.
- The three test binaries are independent: touching a sequence test case does
  not invalidate the component or class test binary.
