# Decision Record: How to integrate external tools

Scope: How we integrate external development/support tools (linters, formatters, analyzers, code generators, license checkers, etc.) into SCORE development.

## Requirements

1) Version Pinning: Tool versions are pinned and identical across CLI, CI, and IDE; hashes / versions verified; no unpinned transitive downloads.
2) Config Pinned: All tool configuration files are identical across CLI, CI, and IDE.
3) Performance: Tools install and run sufficiently fast, especially in CI environments. Expensive tools leverage (Bazel) caching where feasible.
4) Offline & Retention: Tools can be pre-fetched, e.g. for ≥10 years reproducibility or offline use.
5) Platforms: Tools support Linux x86_64 and aarch64.
6) Security & Compliance: Tools follow SCORE security & safety policies of score process.
7) Low Friction Integration: Extra code per-repository is minimized; shared wrappers/macros preferred.
8) Effort: Maintenance effort is minimized for S-CORE.


## Alternatives

### bazel aspects
*...*

* Supports multiple python versions
* Supports individual dependencies per target
* Supports individual configs per target?

### bazel multitool
*Provides tools in a architecture agnostic way*

* Central management of tool versions
* Rather simple approach (setup, usability)

### devcontainer

### native
